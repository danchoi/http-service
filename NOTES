Maybe the HTTP service can be used by IW for API requests.

The HTTP service can throttle to keep things under a rate limit, and
also track the requests over time.


Resources:
  urls
    url
  requests
    request_id
    url
    redirected to
    response
    time elapsed
    content_type
  crawl:
    a collection of requests


psql http-service -c 'select url, response_code, content_type, error from requests'

psql http-service -c 'select crawl_id, url, response_code, content_type, latency, error from requests'
